# Context
Advent of Code is an annual advent calendar of programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl. This repository contains my personal solutions for the 2025 challenges.

Some test cases intentionally fail because the input files required for solving my specific puzzles are not included in the repository. This follows the guidelines provided by Advent of Code regarding redistribution restrictions:

> Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code? Please don't. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.
